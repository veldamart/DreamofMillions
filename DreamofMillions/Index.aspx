         Finding your next Rental Dream home does not have to be complicated.
         Tenants for the first time you are able to search properties and contact the property owners 
         without any fees involved. Tenants who often pay hefty fees for finding a new rental can now 
         get exposure to listing not yet on the market allowing landlords to find tenants faster.
